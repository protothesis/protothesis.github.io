# 🧑‍🚀 Hello, Visitor

## protothesis.github.io

This is an experiment in Git hosted webpage powered by Astro.

- Trying to move away from cargo.site as a webdesign platform.
- Unhappy with wordpress.
- Curious about modern web development practices.

I'm embarrassed to say, im starting from a template and am deploying without removing all the crap first. Hopefully no one will see this.
