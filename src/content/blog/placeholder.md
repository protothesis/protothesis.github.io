# Placeholder Header

This is a placeholder blog post. Just want to get some content on the page so as not to keep confusing myself with the test deployment of the blog.

That was an autogenerated entry based on my previous text. Very strange learning how to use this shit. 

Mainly I want to see if I understand the "content" pipeline using VS code alone as a blog maker. 
TL:DR, so far it sucks. And I'm pretty sure I'm gonna want a CMS, or at least something with a proper Markdown editor, cause this experience isnt pleasant. 

*Signing off...*
