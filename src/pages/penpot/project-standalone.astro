        What comes after the destruction wrought from the apocalypse? One
        wonders about the terrible beauty of a despoiled world healing after our
        demise.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the era of looming climate catastrophe, dialog often revolves around
        the destruction of the planet. The evidence of radical change is all
        around us; and from our perspective, nature is raging. Though is it not
        a hubris of human civilization to think that we could truly kill this
        world?
      </p>

      <p>
        While we are agents of planetary change, the 'destruction of the planet'
        is likely to be only a species wide suicide. The end of the world as we
        know it will be a flourishing of life that once struggled to survive
        amid our dominant reign.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the origins of the well known Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse come
        from the Christian tradition, they exist in pop consciousness simply as
        a symbol for the end of the world. In such a post human context, what
        place is there for personified allegorical figures?
      </p>

      <p>
        The horses of doom will be released from their dreadful bondage, and
        return to a state of wild harmony with the abundance of life that will
        surely flourish amid the scattered and disintegrating remains of
        humanity.
